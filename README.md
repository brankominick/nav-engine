## Data
Datasets were found through [Open Data Philly](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/?category=transportation) which provides an accessible interface to data from [Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access](https://www.pasda.psu.edu/), PennDOT, and other sources.

So far, this project makes use of [Street Centerlines](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/street-centerlines/), [Street Nodes](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/street-nodes/), and [PA Traffic Counts](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/pa-dot-traffic-counts/).
